           <em> Artificial intelligence</em> is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
          
          
        </p>
       
        <h3>What Is AI?</h3>
        <p>
            At its core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing‚Äôs question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines. The expansive goal of AI has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.
        </p>

        <p>
            The major limitation in defining AI as simply ‚Äúbuilding machines that are intelligent‚Äù is that it doesn't actually explain what AI is and what makes a machine intelligent. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.
        
        </p>
        <p>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DEFINED: FOUR TYPES OF APPROACHES</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Thinking humanly: mimicking thought based on the human mind.</li>
          <li>Thinking rationally: mimicking thought based on logical reasoning.</li>
          <li>Acting humanly: acting in a manner that mimics human behavior.</li>
          <li>Acting rationally: acting in a manner that is meant to achieve a particular goal.</li>
        </ol>
       

        <h3>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
            The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and doling out different treatments tailored to specific patients, and for aiding in surgical procedures in the operating room.
      
        </p>
        
        <p>Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account deposits‚Äîall of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.</p>
      <h3>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      <p>Artificial intelligence can be categorized into one of four types.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Reactive AI</li>
        <li>Limited memory AI</li>
        <li>Theory-of-mind AI </li>
        <li>Self-aware AI</li>
      </ol>
